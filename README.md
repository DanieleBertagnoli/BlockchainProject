# Crowdfunding DApp on Ethereum Blockchain

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a decentralized application (DApp) on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating a crowdfunding system. Users have the flexibility to either create their fundraising campaigns or contribute to existing ones. Key features include MetaMask integration for secure wallet interactions, the creation of DSTKNs (Dragon Sphere Tokens) to empower users, the ability to participate in crowdfunding activities, and the implementation of Truffle for streamlined smart contract development and testing.

## Tasks

### 1. MetaMask Integration
MetaMask integration is a critical component of our DApp, providing users with a seamless and secure way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask serves as the bridge between the DApp and users' Ethereum wallets, enabling them to manage funds, create campaigns, and make donations.

### 2. Create DSTKNs and Their Achieving/Spending Logic
DSTKNs (Dragon Sphere Tokens) play a crucial role in our crowdfunding DApp. Users earn DSTKNs proportionally to their donations on the platform. These tokens not only represent a user's contribution but also grant voting rights in the platform's governance, allowing users to report suspicious campaigns.

### 3. Create or Donate to a Campaign
Users have the flexibility to either initiate their fundraising campaigns or contribute to existing ones. This functionality is the core of the crowdfunding DApp, promoting community involvement and financial support for various projects.

### 4. Implement Truffle for Smart Contract Development and Testing
Truffle is a powerful development framework for Ethereum that simplifies the process of writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Implementing Truffle into our project will enhance the efficiency and reliability of smart contract development.

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a user-friendly and secure crowdfunding DApp on the Ethereum blockchain. Through MetaMask integration, DSTKN creation, the ability to create or donate to campaigns, and the implementation of Truffle for smart contract development and testing, users will experience a seamless and transparent platform for supporting a wide array of projects.
